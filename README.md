## Testing

- Users should type valid text to continue the game. Otherwise, they see the error messages.
- The game was tested on Anaconda and Heroku Terminal.
- No error when the code was passed through the PEP8 <https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com>.
- I have checked different scenarios of the game and confirm that all of them work correctly.

## Fixed Bugs

- When a user was captured by snake or spider and select y to play again, the picked up items from right door did not remove from the selection list. Adding:
  - has_candle = False
  - has_matches = False
  - has_knife = False
  - has_hammer = False
  - has_rope = False 
to the right_door function solved the bug.  


## Deployment

- I followed the steps written below to deploy my project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), based on the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) instructions:

    - First created a Heroku account by flollowing the instructions given from Code Institute.

    - used the pip3 freeze > requirements.txt command to install our dependencies to Heroku.

    - Commit changes push the changes to Github: git commit -m "Add requirements for deployment‚Äù

    - In HEROKU after creating the account:

    - "Create new App".

    - Give the App a unique name and enter region.

    - Click on "Create App".

    - Click on "Settings" on your new App Dashboard.

    - Scroll down to Config Vars to add creds.json files and KEY: PORT and VALUE: 8000 for the deployment.

    - Press Add-button.

    - Scroll down to Buildpacks and press the icon for Python, click Save Changes, then press the icon for Nodejs and save changes. These Buildpacks need to be in the same order as below:

        - Python
        - NodeJS
    - Go to Deploy section tab and scroll down to the Deployment Method. Connect to Github pages and then could search for my Github Repository "Project_3" and then click connect.

    - Scroll down to Manual Deploys sections, then press Deploy Branch.

    - After the project has been deployed successfully I clicked the View-button to see the program run in the terminal.
